"""Render DIAL, COST, DELTA and ABSTENTION from whatever cells exist on disk.

Thin by rule, and NUMERIC LITERALS ARE BANNED IN THIS FILE — enforced by
tools/lint_no_numbers.py. Every number that reaches the room comes from a Metric
carried in a cell file, never from something typed here. A typed number is
indistinguishable from a measured one once it is on a projector.

`--reference=compare` is the mode a cloner wants: their own cells and the committed
baseline, side by side, with the difference between them computed. `fill` was the only
behaviour available, and it deleted the stored cell as soon as a live one existed.

**It is not the default, and that is the point.** `compare` was, for every caller — so
this command on a fresh clone rendered twelve finished bars and the pre-registered
p-value on a machine that had never made an API call. The default is `auto`: `compare`
once this run has a cell of its own, `hide` until then. See `sweep.reference.MODE_AUTO`.

Safe to run while the sweep is still going: cells still running render as in-progress.
