# freezing was verified, and a worker cell re-run at any later date — different code,
# different pricing table, different gold set — in that directory passed untouched,
# because the cells it checked were never involved.

# The fixture builds its frontier cells FROM the committed reference rather than
# copying results/sweep/, which a fresh clone does not have. A guard's own test must
