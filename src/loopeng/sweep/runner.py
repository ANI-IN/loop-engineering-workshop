"""The 8-cell sweep: resumable, progressive, and self-aborting on PROJECTED spend.

Three properties matter more than the numbers it produces.

**It resumes from `results/`, not from LangSmith.** Gate 0 measured that LangSmith
re-runs everything on restart rather than skipping completed work, so a cell that
finished is a file on disk and nothing else is consulted. A dropped connection costs
the cell in flight, never the cells behind it.

**It aborts on projected spend, not on actual.** Checking actual spend against the cap
only discovers the breach after it happened. Before every cell the runner adds what it
has already spent to what the remaining cells are projected to cost, and refuses to
start if that total exceeds the cap. Aborting in front of a room mid-sweep is the
failure this design exists to avoid.

**Incomplete cells are never blank, never zero, and never a guess.** A cell in progress
reports "in progress, n=NN so far" with the interval over what has landed. A zero on a
chart reads as a measurement.
