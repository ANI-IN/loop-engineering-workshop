"""What both chart renderers agree on, defined once.

There are two renderers, and the reason is lifetime rather than medium.
`loopeng.sweep.charts` draws whatever is on disk NOW: a figure has to degrade to "in
progress, n=NN so far" and is redrawn as a sweep lands, so it is not required to be
byte-identical between runs. `tools/render_readme_charts.py` draws a frozen measurement
that ships in the README, where byte-identity is the property that makes a change to an
image always a change to the data. Both are matplotlib.

(That was not the reason on file. The live backend hand-assembled SVG, justified by
"no plotting dependency to install at a venue" — untrue, matplotlib rendered `assets/`
and `uv sync` installed it — and by "the live Gradio views", which do not consume these
figures at all. See `sweep/charts.py`.)

What was NOT a real reason was implementing the shared layer twice. Both independently
carried cell ordering, worker/frontier colouring, the hatched-outline convention for
stored bars, the value-and-n gutter — and **their own copies of the caption prose**.
`DIAL_CAPTION` and `REFERENCE_CAPTION` existed in each file, and the Wilson and cluster
caveats were typed out twice, so a correction to one did not reach the other. That is the
drift README §6 argues against when it justifies thin demo files, applied to the two
places where a disclosure reaching a reader actually matters.

So: the prose and the cell-to-row transform live here. Only geometry and drawing calls
stay backend-specific.

THE ORDERING CHANGED, DELIBERATELY
----------------------------------

`reference` used to be the FIRST sort key, so every stored cell sorted into a block at
the bottom — live bars, then stored bars. It is now the LAST key, which puts each stored
cell immediately beneath its live counterpart. In `fill` mode the keys are disjoint and
nothing is adjacent to anything, so this only shows up in `compare` mode, which is where
"paired on the same row" is the entire point.

    "re-run — and they are drawn differently so that is impossible to miss. Presenting "
    "a stored number as though it had just been computed would break the cost "

DELTA_CAPTION = (
    "Paired differences in silent-error rate, in percentage points. Positive means the "
    "second arm has MORE silent errors. Zero is drawn: it is a real delta, not a missing "

    "set the p-value uses — so it will not always equal the gap between the two bars on "
    "DIAL, and where it does not, the bars are the misleading pair. Significance is "
    f"exact McNemar. Below {MIN_DISCORDANT} discordant pairs no split of the data can "
    f"reach p < {ALPHA}, so those rows say so instead of showing a number. Intervals are "
    f"a normal approximation on the paired difference. {CLUSTER_CAVEAT} A systematic "
    "weakness in one pattern can produce five discordant pairs that are really one "
    "observation, so the honest statement is directional."
