"""What actually happened to an answer, judged against gold after the fact.

Deliberately separate from the loop. The loop never sees gold; this module does. Same
isolation the VerifyContext contract enforces in Phase 2, applied one phase early.

**The visible/silent split decides what the headline number means.**

    VISIBLE : invalid SQL, execution error, QueryTimeout, empty result.
              Something plainly went wrong and an operator would see it.
    SILENT  : the query ran, returned something plausible, and is wrong.

**Silent-error rate is computed only over answers that ran and returned something.**
Folding visible failures in would inflate the headline with failures the room can
already see, which is the opposite of what the metric is for. The two counts are
reported separately and never summed into one rate.

**The taxonomy uses the per-rule naive variants built in Phase 0.** An answer matching
the variant for rule X exactly is "ignored rule X" — a different and far more useful
statement than "wrong". For the one item whose variants collide, both rules are
reported and neither is picked: saying "soft_delete or internal_accounts" is honest,
and choosing one would be a coin flip presented as a finding.

    This is VISIBLE, not silent, and the distinction is the project's own definition
    rather than a convenience: a silent error is one you cannot detect without knowing
    the answer. A column count is knowable without the answer — you asked for one
    number and got three — so anyone consuming the result sees it immediately.

    It is a real category, not a technicality. Measured on the first Phase 1 trap: 11
    of 35 apparent silent errors were a model returning the right numbers alongside an
    extra label column, e.g. (product_id, category, units) where the gold SQL returns
    (product_id, units). Scoring those as silent errors measured how precisely the
    question pinned down an output schema, not whether the model understood the
    business rules — and it inflated the headline number by a third.

    ROW count counts too, and originally did not. Phase 4 triage found a query that
    returned 105 rows where gold had 1 — an aggregate that never collapsed — classified
    as a SILENT error because only the column count was compared. Asking for one number
    and receiving a hundred and five is as visible as receiving three columns, so it
    belongs in the same bucket. The asymmetry was ours, not the model's.

    An order-sensitive item is exempt from the row check, because a top-N query
    legitimately returns many rows and a wrong N is a wrong ranking, not a shape.

    Measured on the Phase 1 trap: p06_top_products__04 returned the same five products
    with the same five counts, ordering the two products tied at 120 the other way,
