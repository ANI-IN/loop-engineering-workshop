"""Two cents' worth of checks, before anything expensive.

The smallest live path used to be `--profile delivery`: 4 cells, 50 items, ~200 calls,
projected est. $0.43. A first-time cloner had no way to spend a fraction of a cent
finding out whether their key was valid, whether both model ids resolved **on their
account**, and whether the warehouse and gold set built at all. They found out by
starting the thing that spends.

So this runs in order, prints pass/fail per line, and stops at the first failure that
makes the next check meaningless. Four properties are load-bearing:

**Each model is called with the request kwargs the registry declares.** Not a
simplified probe call. `temperature=0` is legal on Haiku and a 400 on Sonnet 5, and a
preflight that omitted the kwargs would pass on an account where the sweep fails.

**Only `max_tokens` is trimmed, and only if it can be.** It caps thinking plus output on
the frontier role, so it is left alone there; cost is driven by the tokens actually
produced, and "reply with one word" produces few of them either way.

**Steps 3 and 4 make no network calls at all.** The warehouse, the gold set and the rule
surface are offline, so they are checked even when the key is bad — a cloner with a typo
still learns that the rest of their checkout is sound.

**Cost carries `est.`** Tokens are measured; dollars are a price table. §13 is right.
