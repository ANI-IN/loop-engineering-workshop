"""Push the frozen exhibit to a Hugging Face Space, in one step.

Replaces a shell script that filtered by copying only what it wanted. Copying the
right things is not the same as refusing the wrong ones: a filter that misses is
silent, and what it would leak here is either a credential or a stored sweep cell
that makes a chart look computed.

So this **asserts** rather than trusts. Every file staged for the push is checked
against the forbidden set, and a single match aborts before anything is pushed.

WHAT MUST NEVER REACH THE SPACE
-------------------------------

  .env                 credentials. The Space needs none and gets none.
  results/sweep/       live cell output. A stored cell on a public page renders as
  results/ablation/    though it had just been computed, which is the one thing
                       this project refuses.
  *.duckdb             generated data. The Space rebuilds the warehouse from the
                       seed at startup and asserts its checksum.

WHY THE SPACE IS SAFE WITHOUT A KEY
-----------------------------------

It runs the EXHIBIT profile: no roles, no cells, a zero spend cap. The guarantee
is structural rather than quantitative — `tests/test_exhibit.py` spies on the
`anthropic.Anthropic` constructor and asserts none is ever built. That test is the
security boundary, and it is why a public Space here cannot spend anyone's money.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Spaces do not use uv. `deploy/hf/requirements.txt` is generated from `uv.lock` by
`--write-requirements`, pinned, and restricted to what the exhibit actually
imports — the first attempt exported all of the lock and failed to build, because
the Space's interpreter is older than the one uv resolved against.
